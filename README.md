**INTRODUCTION**

 This will be a repository for all the mods/updates to mods I make for Gauntlet. 
 These mods are to increase the usability of various items and weapons, as well as increase the difficulty of the base game.
 If you are looking for what has changed/what the various updates look like, you can reference this doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfsMqwef7iAWKhtHhQQnJ5oTKv-PPJE1pd_SQRdwc8vawOF17ffCnCwFJ8pJothJhKwvqcEp_V7JbH/pubhtml


**Installation**

 To install you just need to extract the contents into the Mod Folder (you can find the mod loader here https://github.com/Aussiemon/Gauntlet-Slayer-Edition-Mod-Loader/tree/main )
 You can find a step by step guide here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHv1Hnhmpo
 
**Uninstalling**

 Simply remove the "mod" folder from your games base directory, and then run a validation check in steam. Or if you made a backup of the Contents folder simply drag the original 9e13b2414b41b842 back into the Contents folder and overwrite the modded version
